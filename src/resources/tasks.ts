  /**
   * Create and start a new Browser Use Agent task.
   *
   * This is the main endpoint for running AI agents. You can either:
   *
   * 1. Start a new session with a new task.
   * 2. Add a follow-up task to an existing session.
   *
   * When starting a new session:
   *
   * - A new browser session is created
   * - Credits are deducted from your account
   * - The agent begins executing your task immediately
   *
   * When adding to an existing session:
   *
   * - The agent continues in the same browser context
   * - No additional browser start up costs are charged (browser session is already
   *   active)
   * - The agent can build on previous work
   *
   * Key features:
   *
   * - Agent profiles: Define agent behavior and capabilities
   * - Browser profiles: Control browser settings and environment (only used for new
   *   sessions)
   * - File uploads: Include documents for the agent to work with
   * - Structured output: Define the format of the task result
   * - Task metadata: Add custom data for tracking and organization
   *
   * Args:
   *
   * - request: Complete task configuration including agent settings, browser
   *   settings, and task description
   *
   * Returns:
   *
   * - The created task ID together with the task's session ID
   *
   * Raises:
   *
   * - 402: If user has insufficient credits for a new session
   * - 404: If referenced agent/browser profiles don't exist
   * - 400: If session is stopped or already has a running task
